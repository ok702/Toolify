Tools Wonder (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù ‚Äúus‚Äù) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our website and tools.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data such as your name, email, or contact details.

Files you upload to use our tools (e.g., image converter, PDF tools, audio tools) are processed directly in your browser. They are not uploaded to any server we control.

2. How Your Files Are Handled

All file processing happens locally on your device using browser technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Your files remain private and are not transmitted to us or any third-party server.

3. Use of Third-Party Services

Our site is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may automatically collect basic, non-identifying information such as IP address and browser type for security and analytics purposes.

If we use third-party services (e.g., Google Analytics, advertisements), they may set cookies or collect limited usage data. We will update this policy if such services are added.

By default, Tools Wonder does not use cookies for tool functionality.

Third-party services (if integrated in the future, e.g., ads or analytics) may use cookies according to their own policies.

Our website and tools are designed for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.
